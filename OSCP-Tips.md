5 Keys to the OSCP

There is approximately one full OSCP review for everyone who passed the exam before me: I read dozens before attempting the course and more before attempting the exam. Instead of writing another one of those, I've decided to boil down my experience to five key pointers I wish I had been given before attempting the exam. I hope that someone benefits from the following advice:

Complete the Exercise Writeup

I decided to attempt the OSCP exam without completing the lab manual exercise writeup for 5 bonus points toward my exam score. 5/100 points seemed insignificant at the time. 5 points did not seem insignificant when I had been hacking for approximately 22 hours straight and knew that a user-level shell on one machine or privilege escalation on another would put me at or over the 70-point threshold into passing territory. I firmly believe that I would have passed the exam on my first attempt if I had the 5 extra points in my pocket. Completing all of the lab exercises before my next attempt renewed my confidence and gave me those sweet, sweet bonus points I knew could be crucial to pass.

Complete the Exercise Writeup

If you're on the fence about doing the writeup even after reading the above, please picture yourself with minutes left in your exam time feeling hopeless with the knowledge that you might've pulled out a passing grade if you had submitted the exercises. Just do it!

Sleep (if you feel like it)

I'm not going to say that you need to sleep during your exam time in order to perform well on the exam: everyone works differently. I found that taking a few hours off allowed me to come back to the machines with a fresh perspective. I slept for approximately 5 hours on my passing attempt and found multiple flags in the morning before my time expired!
